// Assignment 42
// 42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a 
// function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the 
// phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the 
// list has actually been modified.
let magicians: string[] = ["Alice", "David", "Chris"];

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]) {
  magicians.forEach((magician) => {
    console.log(magician);
  });
}
function make_great (magician: string[]){
    for (let i = 0; i < magician.length; i++) {
        magician[i] = magician[i] + " The Great";
        
    }
}

make_great(magicians); //Modifies the original arry
show_magicians(magicians); //shows modify names
